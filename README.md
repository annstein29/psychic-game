What the project does

This game has you playing against the computer. 

The computer will pick a random letter and will wait until you choose one. 

It will give you 10 tries. 

If you choose the letter the computer selected you will have a "win" marked in your tally.

If you do not choose the letter the computer selected in those 10 guesses you will have a "loss" marked in your tally. 

Keep playing until you have the number of wins you want against the computer.

Good Luck!
